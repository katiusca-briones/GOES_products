    "description": "The Level 2+ products contain environmental physical quantities, such as Cloud Top Height, Land Surface (Skin) Temperature, and Hurricane Intensity. Except for the Lightning Detection product, the primary source for generating the Level 2+ products are the 16 bands of ABI Level 1b Radiances product data. In addition to the ABI Level 1b data, National Weather Prediction (NWP) forecast model output data, which is received by the GOES-R series ground system several times a day, is key ancillary source data for generating several of the Level 2+ products. Furthermore, there are a few other dynamic ancillary data sets used in the generation of Level 2+ product containing information, such as current snow and ice extents, and sea surface temperature in the western hemisphere. There are nine types of Level 2+ products. There are one or more Level 2+ products of each type. The types of Level 2+ products are as follows: • Clouds • Aerosols • Atmospheric Vertical Profiles • Precipitation • Winds • Land • Ocean • Radiation • Lightning",
